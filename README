==USAGE==
Use Power_Supply() to create an object for every physical power supply you have.  Then attach lights to each power supply using the addLight() method and the appropriate light class (right now there's a class for Colorblasts and another for Flex lights).  Set the state attribute of each light to the desired color and then write the data using the Power_Supply class's write() method.

While this seems a bit convoluted at first, this makes sense because it allows you to program what you want each light to do without thinking about what power supply its attached to, and then allows the power supply to do all of the DMX formatting for you.

Two examples are in examples.py, while a non-object oriented script is in example-script.py.
